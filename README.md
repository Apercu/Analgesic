Have you ever noticed being annoyingly redirected while clicking on a link? If you're only using google,
you might not have seen it, but on other services, like slack, it can be very pronounced due to their shorter server budget.
The only reason behind this blasphemy is (you maybe guessed it thanks to the logo) analytics. I, and certainly others,
don't want to be bothered in my navigation by this sole purpose I gain nothing from.

Another new trend among some websites I would keep silent their name, is to override the paste event on some inputs
to force you to re-enter manually your email or other fields you need to confirm. Well just let me do my thing okay?
I understand maybe 5% of your users are dumb enough to copy a wrong entry, but it's not a reason to shit on the head of your
experienced users.

This extension might be incomplete and missing critical misbehaviors we need to patch up, do not hesitate to help complete
it by making an issue or a PR.
